# Vectorized Data Storage (for RAG Chatbot)

## Description:
All processed and vectorized information for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot will be stored in a dedicated vector database and that will be stored here in this directory/folder. This enables fast semantic search and retrieval, which is essential for generating accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.
